ToDo
====
This is an Android Application for the To Do List.

Time Spent (Coding App): 4 hours (including watching videos)
Time Spent (Setup): too much and ongoing.... Had difficulties with Eclipse on my computer, but was able to set up the Android Studio v19 late yesterday and get the app built.

Completed User Stories:

* [x] First Version of the App, [ToDoActivity] a list of ToDo Items Saved to file that can have items added to it (text field and Add button) or removed from it (long click)
* [x] Edit feature added to the First Version, a click of an item in To Do list leads to the next activity [EditItemActivity] where you can edit that item and then Save and return to the [ToDoActivity] where your changes will be reflected and saved to file.

Notes:  Extension to be added today.
